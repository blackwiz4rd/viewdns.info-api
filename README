This awesome site called: http://viewdns.info/ has a bunch of DNS tools.  They also provide an API.  

I plan on writting a full BASH and Python script that will allow you to run every available tool from a terminal.

run: bash viewdns.bash

More to come. Needed to push it to github before I left for the day.
